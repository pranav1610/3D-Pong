3D Pong

## Overview
Concepts of computer graphics used to simulate the 3D version of ping-pong

## Details
- Matrix transformations are used to model the 3D room by transforming cubicle walls.
- Phong shading is employed to provide a smooth shading to the objects.
- Matrix transformations are also used to control the direction in which the ball heads after hitting the paddle or the table.
- Plane equations to detect collision of the ball with the paddle and with the table are used.
- Interpolations are used to provide a smooth motion of the user controlled paddle(user interaction).
